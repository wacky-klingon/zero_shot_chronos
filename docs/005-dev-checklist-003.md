# Developer Checklist: Advanced Chronos Implementation

This checklist covers the implementation of `003-finetuning.md` - the advanced features including fine-tuning, custom model integration, and model comparison.

## Status

**PLACEHOLDER DOCUMENT**

This checklist will be created after the basic Chronos implementation (002-implementation-01.md) is complete and tested.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Complete 002-implementation-01.md first
- [ ] Basic Chronos forecasting working
- [ ] Core modules implemented and tested
- [ ] Data loading pipeline functional
- [ ] Basic visualization working

## Next Steps

Once the foundation is complete, this checklist will be expanded to include:

- Fine-tuning implementation tasks
- Custom model integration steps
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Advanced visualization features
- Experiment tracking and logging
- Performance optimization tasks
