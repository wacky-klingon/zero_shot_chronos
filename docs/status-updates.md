## Update 2
### Current Status - Architecture Pivot

#### Major Architecture Change

The project has undergone a significant architecture pivot from AutoGluon-based implementation to direct Chronos integration. This change was driven by the requirement to support locally trained custom Chronos models.

##### **Previous Implementation Issues**
The initial AutoGluon-based approach encountered fundamental limitations:
- AutoGluon's preset system doesn't support custom trained models
- Model loading was incompatible with locally stored Chronos model files
- Configuration structure was misaligned with custom model requirements

##### **New Architecture - Direct Chronos Integration**
The project has been restructured to use Chronos directly:

**Dependencies Updated** - Replaced AutoGluon-TimeSeries with direct Chronos dependencies:
- `chronos>=0.1.0` (main forecasting library)
- `huggingface-hub>=0.16.0` (model downloading)
- `torch>=2.0.0` (PyTorch backend)
- `transformers>=4.30.0` (Hugging Face transformers)

**Core Modules Redesigned** - All modules updated for direct Chronos usage:
- Data loader now returns pandas DataFrames instead of TimeSeriesDataFrame
- Chronos predictor uses `ChronosPipeline` directly
- Model management system for versioned model storage
- Enhanced visualization with uncertainty quantification

**Configuration Restructured** - Updated to support:
- Versioned model management (`data/models/{model-type}/{version}/`)
- Model path, type, and version tracking
- Loading mode configuration (inference vs training)
- Auto-detection of model availability

##### **Current Implementation Status**
**Basic Structure** - Core architecture redesigned and documented
**Model Management** - Versioned storage system implemented
**Download System** - Enhanced model downloader with conversion
**Documentation** - Implementation guides updated for new architecture

**Remaining Work** - Core modules need implementation:
- Data loader requires Chronos-specific data preparation
- Chronos predictor needs direct Chronos integration
- Visualization needs uncertainty plot support
- Main script requires workflow updates

##### **Key Changes Made**
- Replaced AutoGluon dependencies with Chronos
- Updated project structure for model versioning
- Redesigned configuration for custom model support
- Created enhanced model management system
- Updated documentation to reflect new architecture

##### **Next Steps**
- Implement core modules with direct Chronos integration
- Test model loading and prediction functionality
- Validate custom model support
- Complete end-to-end workflow testing
