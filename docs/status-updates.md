# Status Updates 

## Update 2
### Current Status - Architecture Pivot

#### Major Architecture Change

The project has undergone a significant architecture pivot from AutoGluon-based implementation to direct Chronos integration. This change was driven by the requirement to support locally trained custom Chronos models.

##### **Previous Implementation Issues**
The initial AutoGluon-based approach encountered fundamental limitations:
- AutoGluon's preset system doesn't support custom trained models
- Model loading was incompatible with locally stored Chronos model files
- Configuration structure was misaligned with custom model requirements

##### **New Architecture - Direct Chronos Integration**
The project has been restructured to use Chronos directly:

**Dependencies Updated** - Replaced AutoGluon-TimeSeries with direct Chronos dependencies:
- `chronos>=0.1.0` (main forecasting library)
- `huggingface-hub>=0.16.0` (model downloading)
- `torch>=2.0.0` (PyTorch backend)
- `transformers>=4.30.0` (Hugging Face transformers)

**Core Modules Redesigned** - All modules updated for direct Chronos usage:
- Data loader now returns pandas DataFrames instead of TimeSeriesDataFrame
- Chronos predictor uses `ChronosPipeline` directly
- Model management system for versioned model storage
- Enhanced visualization with uncertainty quantification

**Configuration Restructured** - Updated to support:
- Versioned model management (`data/models/{model-type}/{version}/`)
- Model path, type, and version tracking
- Loading mode configuration (inference vs training)
- Auto-detection of model availability

##### **Current Implementation Status**
**Basic Structure** - Core architecture redesigned and documented
**Model Management** - Versioned storage system implemented
**Download System** - Enhanced model downloader with conversion
**Documentation** - Implementation guides updated for new architecture

**Remaining Work** - Core modules need implementation:
- Data loader requires Chronos-specific data preparation
- Chronos predictor needs direct Chronos integration
- Visualization needs uncertainty plot support
- Main script requires workflow updates

##### **Key Changes Made**
- Replaced AutoGluon dependencies with Chronos
- Updated project structure for model versioning
- Redesigned configuration for custom model support
- Created enhanced model management system
- Updated documentation to reflect new architecture

##### **Next Steps**
- Implement core modules with direct Chronos integration
- Test model loading and prediction functionality
- Validate custom model support
- Complete end-to-end workflow testing

## Update 3 - September 20, 2025 21:45
### Current Status - Parquet Data Loader Implementation

#### Major Feature Addition

The project has successfully implemented a comprehensive parquet data loading system, significantly enhancing data handling capabilities for large-scale time series forecasting.

##### **Parquet Loader Implementation**

A complete parquet data loading system has been developed with the following components:

**Core Architecture:**
- **ParquetDataLoader**: Main orchestrator class with range-based loading
- **FileDiscovery**: Intelligent file discovery with regex pattern matching
- **IdempotencyTracker**: Prevents reprocessing of already handled files
- **AuditLogger**: Complete trace of processing activities
- **SchemaValidator**: Ensures data quality and consistency

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Range-based loading**: Support for year/month ranges (e.g., 2014-2016, Q1-Q2)
- **Idempotency**: Automatic tracking prevents redundant processing
- **Audit logging**: JSON-based session tracking with progress monitoring
- **Fail-fast configuration**: No defaults, explicit configuration required
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy with clear messages

**File Structure Support:**
- Hierarchical organization: `{year}/{month}/{filename}.parquet`
- Pattern matching: `{SYMBOL}_{TIMEFRAME}_{HORIZON}_{YEAR}_{MONTH}_{HASH}.parquet`
- Automatic metadata extraction from filenames
- Graceful handling of missing directories

##### **Integration Status**

**Completed Implementation:**
- All core modules implemented and tested
- Configuration system with Pydantic validation
- Complete exception hierarchy
- Integration examples with Chronos components
- Comprehensive documentation and usage guides

**Documentation Updates:**
- Updated `USAGE.md` with parquet loader instructions
- Created implementation checklist in `03A-implementation.md`
- Added configuration templates and examples
- Provided troubleshooting and performance guidance

##### **Technical Specifications**

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Chunked loading for large datasets
- Memory-efficient processing
- Atomic file operations for state management
- Checksum-based change detection

**Configuration Management:**
- YAML-based configuration with validation
- Fail-fast approach with no default values
- Flexible range specification
- Comprehensive error reporting

**Data Quality Assurance:**
- Schema validation on load
- Type conversion and validation
- Missing data handling
- Consistency checks across files

##### **Next Steps**
- Integration testing with real parquet datasets
- Performance benchmarking with large-scale data
- User acceptance testing
- Production deployment preparation
