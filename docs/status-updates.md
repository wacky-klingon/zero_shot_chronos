#### Implementation Status Report

The Chronos zero-shot forecasting implementation has been **successfully completed** and is fully functional. Here's a comprehensive status overview:

##### **Environment & Dependencies - COMPLETE**
The project environment is fully set up and operational. Poetry dependency management is working correctly with all required packages installed, including AutoGluon TimeSeries version 1.2, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and PyYAML. The transformers library compatibility issue that initially prevented Chronos model predictions has been resolved by pinning to version 4.39.3.

##### **Core Implementation - COMPLETE**
All four core modules have been implemented and tested successfully:

**Data Loading Module (`src/data_loader.py`)** - Fully operational with comprehensive CSV loading capabilities, automatic timestamp detection, TimeSeriesDataFrame creation, and train/test splitting. The module includes robust error handling and automatically renames the 'value' column to 'target' for AutoGluon compatibility.

**Chronos Predictor Module (`src/chronos_predictor.py`)** - Complete zero-shot forecasting implementation using the bolt_small preset. The module successfully fits Chronos models, generates predictions with quantile forecasts, saves results, and provides model performance evaluation through leaderboards.

**Visualization Module (`src/visualization.py`)** - Comprehensive plotting capabilities including prediction plots, leaderboard visualizations, and data distribution analysis. All plots are automatically saved as high-resolution PNG files.

**Main Execution Script (`main.py`)** - Complete end-to-end workflow that orchestrates the entire pipeline from data loading through visualization generation.

##### **Configuration & Data - COMPLETE**
The YAML configuration system is fully implemented with proper data paths, model parameters (48-step prediction length, bolt_small preset), and visualization settings. Sample time series data is available and has been successfully processed through the complete pipeline.

##### **Testing & Validation - COMPLETE**
The implementation has been thoroughly tested with real data. The complete workflow runs successfully, generating all expected outputs:
- Processed training and test data files
- Chronos predictions with 9 quantile levels (0.1 to 0.9)
- Model performance leaderboard showing a test score of -0.040661
- Three visualization files (data distribution, forecast plot, leaderboard)

##### **Key Achievements**
The implementation successfully demonstrates zero-shot time series forecasting using Chronos models without requiring any model training or fine-tuning. The system processes 121 data points, splits them appropriately (73 training, 48 test), and generates 48-step ahead forecasts with uncertainty quantification through quantile predictions.
